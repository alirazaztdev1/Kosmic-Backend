# Kosmic-Backend

Kosmic-Backend is a backend server project that provides various features for a multimedia application. It is designed to support video editing, chat functionality, and live streaming capabilities. This project serves as the server-side component to power a comprehensive multimedia application.

## Features

### Video Editing
- API endpoints to upload, store, and retrieve video files
- Video transcoding for different formats and resolutions
- Video editing capabilities, such as trimming, merging, and adding effects
- Integration with video processing libraries or services for advanced editing features

### Chat Features
- Real-time chat functionality with support for multiple users
- APIs for sending and receiving messages
- User authentication and authorization for secure communication
- Support for group chats and private messaging

### Live Streaming
- API endpoints for live streaming setup and management
- Integration with streaming protocols (e.g., RTMP, HLS)
- Support for live video broadcasting and viewing
- Chat integration within live streams for real-time audience interaction

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications
- Express.js: A flexible Node.js web application framework for building APIs
- MongoDB: A popular NoSQL database for storing user data and chat messages
- WebSockets: Real-time communication protocol for chat functionality
- FFmpeg: A powerful multimedia framework for video transcoding and editing
- Streaming protocols (e.g., RTMP, HLS): For live streaming capabilities

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB database

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ````shell
   git clone (https://github.com/alirazaztdev1/Kosmic-Backend.git)
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ````shell
   cd kosmic-backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

   ````plaintext
   MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   ```

   Replace `your-mongodb-uri` with your MongoDB connection URI and `your-jwt-secret` with a secure secret for JWT token generation.

4. Run the server:

   ````shell
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start running at the specified port (default: 3000).

## Usage

Once the server is up and running, you can interact with the API endpoints to utilize the video editing, chat, and live streaming features. The specific endpoints and usage will depend on the implementation details of your project.

You can integrate the backend with a frontend application or test the endpoints using API testing tools (e.g., Postman, curl).
